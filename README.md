Objective:
-------------
This repository is a pointer to some code involving complex and specialized data structures relevant to design and development of effective and efficient software.

Instructions to compile the library:
-------------------------------------
This repository comprises of four projects:

Project 1: In-Memory vs. Disk-Based Searching
Project 2: In-Memory Indexing with Availability Lists
Project 3: Disk-Based Mergesort
Project 4: B-Trees

The instructions to compile the projects:

make PROGRAM=<project_dir_name> : Will compile the selected project and the required infra code. The executable of the program will be created inside that particular project directory.

make clean 	: Cleans the workspace and gets rid of the existing executables.
